Both electric and petrol vehicles have their pros and cons but in my opinion electric vehicles are more convenient and I think they are a better option. Let me list down some keypoints that show how they are a better option.


Electric vehicles use electricity to power their engines instead of gasoline or diesel.
They produce zero emissions while driving, making them a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional vehicles.
The cost of owning and operating an electric vehicle is generally lower than a gas-powered vehicle.
They offer a quiet and smooth driving experience due to the absence

I am currently on my second leased electric car. I got the first in 2017 for zero down and $152/month. It was an amazing deal. It only had a 93 mile range. It was my commuter car and served my needs very well. Add to that there was nearly zero maintenance and I saved about $100 a month compared to gas. I also have a level 2 charger at my house. It would not have worked for me if I had to rely on public charging.

My new EV costs more, but still about the same as a basic Honda or Toyota. The new car gets about 240 miles on a charge and allows greater flexibility. I love the way it drives, the low… (more)

They are still too expensive: If I look at the typical VW Golf, it starts at 21k, the ID3, which is of similar size, starts at 31k. The EV is simpler, what am I getting for the 10k? And if you say, it is better equipped, well can I have the option to strip all that out and save 10k?

Having said all that - we are getting there. The price is not 40 k

The next thing is then charging. A home charger will cost 1 to 1.5k…….

I think I will just squeeze a few more years out of my ICV, it is basically not worth changing yet.

They are fun to drive and are fine. As long as you are just looking for a toy or need a car to tool around town and have the funds to have a charger installed, then go for it. If you rent, live and drive outside the town or travel a bit, they are not for you.

With that said, EV production is now in the air. It takes lithium to produce the battery and with a major producing country shutting down mining over environmental concerns, the future of EVs is in doubt.

Q: What is your opinion on electric vehicles?

They're good. They have two big advantages from where I sit. The first is the convenience of home charging for those drivers who have that option available to them. The second is they don't pollute (I'm not talking CO2 here - that's plant food - but rather the various nitrogen oxides they emit; that's nasty stuff).

These are two good reasons for consumers to consider purchasing an EV if it otherwise makes sense for them to do so.

They’re not for everyone, but they are a good fit for many.

Most of the people telling me a Electric car won’t work for them haven’t done any research or crunched any numbers.

They're a scam to make people think they are smart. The power used to charge the batteries probably comes from a fossil fueled power plant.

I know now you're going to start talking about wind and solar power. They are not reliable, they only work when the weather is within their operating parameters. Storage batteries? They have to be huge and are made with toxic chemicals and rare earth elements mined by slave labor using fossil fueled equipment.

Electric is the wave of the future and will be good for the environment. We need all manufacturers onboard to get the price at competitive and affordable levels. My only hesitancy is the range before recharging. But, I’m sure that shouldn’t be an issue with daily use, only with long trips.

In the year 1900, the entire fleet of New York City taxicabs were electric cars. They were replaced very quickly afterwards with gasoline vehicles because the gasoline vehicles were overall more efficient. That is still the case today, no amount of technology can change the laws of physics. A kilogram of gasoline contains 50 times the density of potential energy as a kilogram of lithium-ion battery. but, hey, I also know you can’t fix stupid, so I have investments in nickel and investments in oil and investments in uranium and they are all making money for me.

Sitting in line at Costco to get gas I was thinking how much nicer it would be to just drive straight to the store and skip this line. Having an electric car would be like having a Costco gas station in my garage selling me the cheapest gas and no lines. Unfortunately there are no electric cars I can flat tow behind my RV and have moderate off road compatibility. When one shows up for under 50K I’ll probably buy it.

They are the future. We have an electric Bolt and a hybrid Prius. We hardly ever drive the Prius, to the point where we need to remember to get it out every month or two to get its battery charged up. The Bolt costs about 1/3 as much per mile to drive, and it make the Prius feel like a plodding tortoise in comparison. The Bolt needs essentially no regular maintenance other than rotating the tires.

We do use the Prius when we drive up to the North Shore of Lake Superior or into north-central Minnesota, both areas where charging infrastructure is still rare, but that’s changing.

That they are not going to work. There's too many problems with them that will kill them off . As you can already see California can't even charge them so they become useless. You will be swamped with toxic used batteries piling up in fields somewhere. The electric grid is not able to supply this load and brownouts or worse will be common occurances. Cost wise they are expensive. Cars going 60,000 and up and battery replacement between 8000 and 26,000. I think we are going to end in disaster.

It is not my personal opinion but its a fact that electric vehicle nowadays is not sustainable because it is powered by the electricity generated from non-renewable sources. Two-thirds of fossil fuels must remain in the ground to avoid catastrophic global warming. To reach that target, we will not be able to burn even a fraction of what are already proven reserves of fossil fuels. Electric vehicle is the future so I am not saying the present is not right. Electric vehicle is good in the short term but in the long run, we need a sustainable alternative.

I bought one 28 months ago. It’s dirt cheap to drive and maintain. It’s also dead-quiet and doesn’t vibrate at all. Like a lot of modern cars, it practically drives itself on the interstate. And you never use the brakes as the car stops by itself.

The only thing about the car that has surprised me is that it’s pretty boring. It never labors up a hill, it never shakes or roars on acceleration. No noxious smells. And I almost miss using my brakes.

EVs (full battery types) are a marvel of engineering, but they will remain a niche vehicle for those who do not drive often, far, or off a schedule.

BEVs are great for those who want to drive to the mass transit point or take the kids to school, but (think about it) they don’t drive far. Their driving is predictable (scheduled) and limited. The savings made to the planet are minimal in terms of carbon footprint. Their CFP was pretty small to begin with.

There is no doubt that electric vehicles are on the rise, and for good reason. Not only do they emit zero emissions, but they also have a much smaller environmental impact than traditional gasoline-powered cars. Some studies have shown that electric vehicles can save you money in the long run because of their lower fuel costs.

Of course, some considerations need to be taken into account when investing in an electric vehicle. For example, you will likely need to invest in a charging infrastructure if you want your car to be able to operate off of electricity alone. And even with this infrastruct… (more)

I love mine. I’ve had it 5 years. I’ve never ran out of charge, even though it has the smallest range battery available (75 miles). I’m saving thousands of dollars by charging over what I used to pay for gas. In my area over the 5 years, the price of electricity has gone up under 4%, and the price of gas has fluctuated wildly - as much as plus 77%.

While I understand a tiny percentage of people’s lifestyles will not permit having an electric, I think the vast majority of gas car drivers would benefit if their next car were an EV.

First, Electric vehicles become common, electric companies will raise their rates to profit from it.

Second, they are NOT “green” as too many people think they are. There is waste products from manufacturing. The batteries that they use create loads of highly toxic waste. Remember that the electricity to charge them has to come from somewhere, so the generating stations will be burning more and more coal to keep up with the demand! Sound Green?

I currently like gas vehicles better AND EVs are a good idea. But they aren't the end-answer for pollution that many think they are.

I agree, but with further improvements in battery technology, especially finding ways to make them out of more sustainable materials, they might be one day. And hopefully we'll get synthetic fuels at reasonable prices. I know that's still inefficient compared to non-combustion solutions but there's much to say for keeping existing vehicles on the road for as long as they are technically sound of the fuel can be made in a carbon neutral way.

Still dirty. Very expensive to repair. Charging times are not practical. No thanks.

They are over hyped in my opinion. When you look at the manufacturing of them they are just as bad if not worse than ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles. An EVs powertrain (mostly the battery) won't out last a GOOD (yes some are shit) ICE powertrain. Not to mention some places, like where I live, still get power by burning coal or natural gas, meaning that they are not better for the environment in anyway. Plus, energy density in batteries just ins't there yet. Something like hydrogen vehicles would be better than regular battery EVs.

I have to use a gas vehicle where I live, it is impractical to use a electric car where there is lots of snow, dirt roads, and no charging stations.

The key to building a car is to simplify and add lightness. Electric motors are great, and I would love one in my car, but batteries are complete and total trash. Until we can get the weight down they're a non starter.

I don't like them because they are far worse for the environment than almost everyone thinks. They are far from future proof, especially with e-fuels getting better.

Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are more reliable, LESS likely to catch on fire/explode, fuel faster, have longer range, and are cheaper.

Ev's are not the answer to climate change while they are good for the environment but only in the long run as batteries produce a lot of C02 when making them

A car is a car (please, feel free to replace the word “car” with any other motorized vehicle type as well). May as well opt for the one that’s doing less damage to our already fairly fucked planet.

They are a good idea, but until they can go longer ranges without a charge + more charging station I don't see me getting one.

Although I would love to get one I don't have that kind of money.

In theory EV's are great. The reality though isn't. A Tesla's carbon footprint isn't much less than a gas powered car. Lithium is mined by child slaves and hard to dispose of. Most of the EV's I've encountered, which I can guarantee is exponentially greater than most due to the nature of my job, aren't as efficient as advertised. The burden on the electrical system is growing. The cost of maintenance is outrageous. They had to recall Chevy Bolt's because the batteries could randomly explode.

they're a way for rich people to cope with what's happening to the environment while getting to buy a fancy car at the same time

trains are infinitely better but worse for rich people, and you can't buy a fancy one for yourself

I don't mind so much as long as they make noise. I've had a close call before with a completely silent car and it scared the crap out of me.

If I ever got a car with a noisemaker (like my mom’s PHEV) I’d 100% cut the noisemaker out of it even if it voids warranties or is illegal.

they are not that bad but i think that ice cars and also hybrids are better

and as a car enthusiast id much rather have a ice car for the engine sound and the fact that you can mod the engine and work on it easyer

Electric vehicles certainly aren't as cool as gas cars but they're ultimately what we'll need to end up using. Gas cars need to be phased out. There's a lot of ethical and environmental issues with mining for electric car batteries and what not. Still, I could see them being the only manufactured vehicles at some point in the next few decades. However, that being said, robust public transportation should come before any car.

Edit: accidentally wrote ""gas car batteries"" instead of electric

How many batteries are in electric cars?

I do agree with you that public transportation should be upgraded before cars. I also think it is a much better idea to get rid of all coal power plants and replace with nuclear before all of that though.

I think personally it's a good idea but it is such a shitty way to introduce them because most EVs are luxury cars rather than cars for the average joe so they are very fucking expensive.

There fine, just they need to charge faster and be more cost effective, apparently replacement batteries can cost up to 20,000 dollars, so until it becomes more affordable and further improved, I have to stick with a gas vehicle, they’re a good idea though

I'll buy one when the range is further than gas, charge time is less than or the same as filling up the tank, when and the batteries don't use material that turns into an unquenchable hellfire if you get into an accident. Also lithium mines use slave labor and that's not good.

Get back to me when graphene has everything fixed.

Even after all that, I'll still need a gas/hybrid Jeep as a second car. You can't carry an extra tank of electricity with you into the backcountry.

Anything is better than ICE as far as climate goes, but EV's are barely an improvement at all compared to e-bikes and public transit.
